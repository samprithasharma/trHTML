        <p> The term web design is normally used to describe the design process relating 
            to the front-end (client side) design of a website including writing markup. 
            Web design partially overlaps web engineering in the broader scope of web development.
             Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and if their role involves creating
              markup then they are also expected to be up to date with web accessibility guidelines.
